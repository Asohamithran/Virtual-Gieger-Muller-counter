# Virtual-Gieger-Muller-counter
## simulation of spontaneous decay in the natural world (e.g. Radioactive decay).
When a particle decays into other particles with no external simulations then it is classified as spontaneous process. Radioactive decay is a spontaneous process but can be approximated as exponential decay when N&rarr; infinity and dt&rarr; 0 . <br>However this is not true for lighter radioactive nuclei, whose decay is a *stochastic* process(contains element of chance )<br>
This simulation produces a beep whenever an atom decays just like conventional Geiger-Muller counters , with a live plot which shows the deviation from exponential behaviour</p> 
#### Let us see the screenshots of the live simulation at different time scales. 
Output showing the number of nuclei vs system time . Each change dent (bend) in the graph indicates a nuclear disintegration. <br>

### Now we can clearly see the distinction between pure exponential decay and stochastic decay of radioactive nuclei.
