# Virtual-Gieger-Muller-counter
## simulation of spontaneous decay in the natural world (e.g. Radioactive decay).
When a particle decays into other particles with no external simulations then it is classified as spontaneous process. Radioactive decay is a spontaneous process but can be approximated as exponential decay when N&rarr; infinity and dt&rarr; 0 . <br>However this is not true for lighter radioactive nuclei, whose decay is a *stochastic* process(contains element of chance )<br>
This simulation produces a beep whenever an atom decays just like conventional Geiger-Muller counters , with a live plot which shows the deviation from exponential behaviour</p>
